# Overview 
Analyzing ride sharing data based on city type (urban, suburban, rural). 

Goals:
* Clean and merge the DataFrames.
* Create a summary DataFrame.
* Create a pivot table DataFrame with the date as the index.
* Create a multiple-line plot for the sum of the fares for each city type.

## Tools/ Languages
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib

# Questions
1. The summary DataFrame shows that there is a correlation between the number of rides and the average fare per ride. The more rides in a given area the lower the average fare per ride will be. The same can be said for the relationship between the number of drivers and average fare per driver. The rideshare company makes more money in areas of denser population, due to high sums of total fares. While individual drivers make more money in a rural areas, due to very low competition. 
2. The line graph that shows the sum of total fares by city type over time depicts that the total fares stay relatively stable for each city type. The urban city type had the highest sum of total fares, which is to be expected.
